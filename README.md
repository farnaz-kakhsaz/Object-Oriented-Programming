# Object-Oriented-Programming
This is my Object Oriented Programming (OOP) practice. don't take it too serious ;)

| Objects                       |
| ----------------------------- |
| Object Literals               |
| Factories                     |
| Constructors                  |
| Constructor Property          |
| Functions are Objects         |
| Value vs Reference Types      |
| Adding or Removing Properties |
| Enumerating Properties        |
| Abstraction                   |
| Getters and Setters           |
| Exercise                      |
